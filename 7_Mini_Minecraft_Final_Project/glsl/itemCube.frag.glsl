#version 150
// ^ Change this to version 130 if you have compatibility issues

// This is a fragment shader. If you've opened this file first, please
// open and read lambert.vert.glsl before reading on.
// Unlike the vertex shader, the fragment shader actually does compute
// the shading of geometry. For every pixel in your program's output
// screen, the fragment shader is run for every bit of geometry that
// particular pixel overlaps. By implicitly interpolating the position
// data passed into the fragment shader by the vertex shader, the fragment shader
// can compute what color to apply to its pixel based on things like vertex
// position, light position, and vertex color.


uniform sampler2D u_Texture;

// These are the interpolated values out of the rasterizer, so you can't know
// their specific values without knowing the vertices that contributed to them

in vec4 fs_UV;
in vec3 fs_Col;

out vec4 out_Col; // This is the final output color that you will see on your
                  // screen for the pixel that is currently being processed.

void main()
{
    out_Col = texture(u_Texture, fs_UV.xy);
}
